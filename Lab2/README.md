## Objectives

The following README summarizes the tasks done during the second lab session
of the Cloud Computing for Big Data Analytics course in Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica
de Catalunya. For project delivery and recovery of information during the course evolution.



### Pre-lab homeworks

-   Registering our app on twitter for accessing the API (Application Programming Interface)
in http://apps.twitter.com

### Lab tasks

- [x] NLTK package setup. Python package for Natural Language Processing. It does not only include algorithms but also linguistic data.
- [x] **Task 2.1.1** [First script]() using NLTK: Tokenizing the whole .txt file, counting the tokens and printing the 10 most common, also printing the total number of words in the file (with and without repetitions)

- [x] Tweepy setup on the python environment. Package to access Twitter data.
- [x] Getting the Twitter credentials from the twitter app created previously.
- [x] Protecting our credentials for being public with environment variables through Pycharm >> Edit configurations. And adding this into the code:

```python
import os

#Credential setup
auth = OAuthHandler(os.environ['CONSUMER_KEY'], os.environ['CONSUMER_SECRET'])
auth.set_access_token(os.environ['ACCESS_TOKEN'], os.environ['ACCESS_SECRET'])
```

**os.environ[key]** returns the value of that certain key in the Environment Variables configuration.

- [x] Accessing profile data with tweepy with [Twitter_1.py]() script.
