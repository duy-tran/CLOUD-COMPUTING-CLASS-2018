## Objectives

The following README summarizes the tasks done during the second lab session
of the Cloud Computing for Big Data Analytics course in Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica
de Catalunya. For project delivery and recovery of information during the course evolution.



### Pre-lab homeworks

-   Registering our app on twitter for accessing the API (Application Programming Interface)
in http://apps.twitter.com

### Lab tasks

#### NLTK

- [x] NLTK package setup. Python package for Natural Language Processing. It does not only include algorithms but also linguistic data.
- [x] **Task 2.1.1** [First script](WordCountTensorFlow_1.py) using NLTK: Tokenizing the whole .txt file, counting the tokens and printing the 10 most common, also printing the total number of words in the file (with and without repetitions)

![Task 2.1.1](img/t211.png)

- [x] **Task 2.1.2** [Second script](WordCountTensorFlow_2.py) modifying the first one. In this case removing the punctuation from the tokens set.

- [x] **Task 2.1.3** For a better analysis of the words used in the file, it is also possible to remove the Stop Words, words language-dependent that are highly used without adding semantic meaning to the context. [Third Script](WordCountTensorFlow_3.py).

#### TWEEPY

- [x] Tweepy setup on the python environment. Package to access Twitter data.
- [x] Getting the Twitter credentials from the twitter app created previously.
- [x] Protecting our credentials for being public with environment variables through Pycharm >> Edit configurations. And adding this into the code:

```python
import os

#Credential setup
auth = OAuthHandler(os.environ['CONSUMER_KEY'], os.environ['CONSUMER_SECRET'])
auth.set_access_token(os.environ['ACCESS_TOKEN'], os.environ['ACCESS_SECRET'])
```

**os.environ[key]** returns the value of that certain key in the Environment Variables configuration.

- [x] Accessing profile data with tweepy with [Twitter_1.py]() script.

![Task 2.2.1](img/t221.png)

- [x] Tweets data can be accessed in multiple ways.
   -   Accessing one tweet text:

   ![One tweet text](img/t2221.png)

   -   Printing the json format of a tweet status: [tweet_status.json](tweet_status.json).
   -   Printing the json format of 10 friend in the twiteer profile: [tw_friends.json](tw_friends.json).
   -   Analysing the json format of our own tweets: [tweet.json](tweet.json).

- [x] Analyzing tweets information by Natural Language processin.
   -   Printing the tokens of the tweet.
